# nischalabraham.xyz

This repository hosts the code for my personal website to highlight my portfolio and show my projects.

## Thinking

I have in the past relied on Tailwind and Typescript for my large scale projects. For this personal portfolio website I wanted to challenge myself to relearn the basics and stick to as much of base CSS as possible. Still using React to speed up development as this technology is what I'm familiar with but removing a few crutches along the way.
